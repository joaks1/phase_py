Overview
========

phase.py is a Python script for automating the process of phasing diploid
consensus DNA sequences into gene copy sequences. It will successfully
phase all sequences with less than 2 heterozygous sites, and will flag
sequences that have 2 or more heterozygous sites.

The package is written by Jamie Oaks of the University of Kansas Department of
Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.

Requirements
============

The script requires DendroPy: http://packages.python.org/DendroPy/

Installation
============

Put the phase.py file in your path.

Citing SeqSift
==============

Please cite the DendroPy library upon which SeqSift depends.
